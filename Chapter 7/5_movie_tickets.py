# 7-5. Movie Tickets: A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending 
# on a personâ€™s age. If a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free;
# if they are between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10; and if they are over age 12,
# the ticket is $15. Write a loop in which you ask users their age,
# and then tell them the cost of their movie ticket.

prompt = "What's your age? "
prompt += "\n(Enter 'quit' when you are finished.) " 

while True:
    answer = input(prompt)

    if answer == 'quit':
        break
    else:
        #making age an int
        age = int(answer)
        
        #comparing ages
        if age < 3:
            print("Your ticket is FREE.")
        elif age > 3 and age < 12:
            print("Your ticket is $10.")
        else:
            print("Your ticket is $15.")
